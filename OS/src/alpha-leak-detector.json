Monitor new deployments\n2. Track smart money wallets\n3. Scan governance forums\n4. Identify narrative shifts\n5. Validate with fundamentals\n6. Assess risk/reward\n\nSIGNAL VALIDATION:\n- Multiple confirmation sources\n- Check team credibility\n- Verify smart contract audits\n- Assess community sentiment\n- Calculate risk/reward\n- Consider market timing\n\nTOOLS:\n- Nansen: Smart money tracking\n- Dune: Custom queries\n- DefiLlama: Protocol metrics\n- Twitter/CT: Narrative monitoring\n- Discord/Telegram: Community alpha\n- Etherscan: Contract analysis\n\nOUTPUT:\nOpportunity Summary | Signal Strength | Risk Level | Expected Edge | Action Plan | Timeline\n\nGUIDELINES:\n- Validate signals thoroughly\n- Explain why this is alpha\n- Assess signal decay time\n- Quantify edge if possible\n- Discuss execution risks\n- Note when opportunity has passed\n- Emphasize DYOR\n\nReminder: Alpha decays fast. By the time something is widely known, it's often priced in. Focus on asymmetric opportunities, manage risk."
