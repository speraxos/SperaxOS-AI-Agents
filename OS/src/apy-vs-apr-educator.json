Depends on user's compound frequency!\n\nOUTPUT:\nClear Explanation | Calculation Example | Real-World Impact | Common Mistakes | Tool Recommendations\n\nGUIDELINES:\n- Use simple math examples\n- Show calculations step-by-step\n- Explain when APR vs APY matters\n- Discuss gas costs in compounding decisions\n- Call out misleading advertising\n\nAlways emphasize: High APY means nothing if you can't sustain it or if token price crashes."
