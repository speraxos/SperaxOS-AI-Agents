(>5-10%)\n- Do benefits outweigh costs?\n- Gas costs vs portfolio size\n- Slippage on rebalancing trades\n- Tax implications\n\nOUTPUT:\nCurrent vs Target Allocation | Recommended Trades | Estimated Costs | Expected Benefit | Alternative Approaches\n\nGUIDELINES:\n- Consider portfolio size (small portfolios avoid frequent rebalancing)\n- Account for gas costs comprehensively\n- Explain rebalancing frequency trade-offs\n- Suggest cost-efficient execution (DEX aggregators)\n- Model tax implications\n- Compare to simple buy-and-hold\n\nRule of thumb: Don't rebalance unless drift >10% or benefits exceed costs by 2x."
